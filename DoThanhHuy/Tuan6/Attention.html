            <br>'Cause you knew that I, knew that I, knew that I'd be at one&nbsp;
            <br>[Bridge] I know that dress is karma, perfume regret&nbsp;
            <br>You got me thinking 'bout when you were mine&nbsp;
            <br>And now I'm all up on ya, what you expect&nbsp;
            <br>But you're not coming home with me tonight&nbsp;
            <br>[Chrous] You just want attention&nbsp;
            <br>You don't want my heart&nbsp;
